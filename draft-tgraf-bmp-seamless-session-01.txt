             BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) Seamless Session
                  draft-tgraf-bmp-seamless-session-01

Abstract

   This document describes a BMP session lifecycle extension to prevent
   data duplication of re-exporting previously exported metrics when BMP
   session is re-established, and prevent loss of metrics between BMP
   session re-establishments to increase overall BMP scalability and
   reduces the possible loss of metrics to a minimum.

1.  Introduction

   With the constant overall increase of BGP paths, the increase of BMP
   BGP RIB coverage from RFC8671 [RFC8671] and draft-ietf-grow-bmp-
   local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib], the addition of new TLV's
   such as draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv
   [I-D.cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv] and draft-xu-grow-bmp-route-
   policy-attr-trace [I-D.xu-grow-bmp-route-policy-attr-trace], more BGP
   metrics and metric dimensions are exported from BMP client to server.

   With each BMP session re-establishment, BMP exports the initial BGP
   RIB with BMP route-monitoring messages as described in section 5 of
   RFC7854 [RFC7854].  Regardless if the same metrics where already
   exported in another BMP session previously or not.  This leads of
   data duplication and unnecessary strain to BMP client and server.

   In most of the times in a network operators network, the BMP session
   is re-established within a short period of time due to connectivity
   interruption or a restart of the BMP server due to maintenance.  Even
   though, most BMP client implementations support a BMP buffer
   mechanism, metrics are not buffered across BMP session re-
   establishment, thus leading to a loss of metrics.

   Therefore, the proposed BMP session lifecycle improvement covers

   o  Brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server

   o  Seamless Maintenance of BMP server

   It is based on RFC7413, TCP Fast Open [RFC7413], targeting this
   existing problem space of transport session high availability for
   other TCP applications.

   It describes how the BMP application MUST behave during TCP transport
   re-establishment period in order to prevent metric loss.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definitions

   Brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server:  Describes
        a period of time in seconds starting from where the BMP client
        detects loss of connectivity to the BMP server and tries to re-
        establish the TCP session.

   Maintenance of BMP server:  Describes a period of time in seconds
        starting from where the BMP server daemon is restarted for
        maintenance purposes and BMP client tries to re-establish the
        TCP session.

   TCP Fast Open:  Describes an extension to speed up the opening of
        successive Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections
        between two endpoints.

4.  BMP Client and Server Capability

   To support brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server,
   the BMP client and server MUST support TCP Fast Open as described in
   RFC7413 [RFC7413].

   To support seamless maintenance of BMP server, the BMP client and
   server MUST support TCP Fast Open as described in RFC7413 [RFC7413]
   AND the restart of the BMP server must distinguish between normal and
   seamless restart, wherever TCP Fast Open cookies are preserved or
   not.

5.  Updated BMP Session Lifecycle

   Section 3 of RFC7413 [RFC7413] describes the TCP Fast Open extension
   in the initial TCP SYN packet and the cookie handling during initial
   and subsequent re-establishment of the TCP transport session.

   Section 3.3 of RFC7854 [RFC7854] describes that the BMP session
   closes with the TCP session.  This behavior is extended with a
   configurable BMP session timeout.

   The BMP session timeout starts counting down under the following
   conditions:

   o  Configured value is bigger than 0

   o  Current TCP session was established with Fast Open extension and
      cookie has been saved

   o  BMP buffer is not full

   o  TCP session is going to be terminated

   The default BMP session timeout is 60 seconds.

   While the time is counting down, all the BMP messages, regardless of
   message type, MUST be buffered.  At this stage, the BMP session is
   still considered to be alive.  When the BMP buffer is full, the BMP
   session remain alive.

   When TCP session is re-established with TCP Fast Open extension and
   cookie is identically to previous TCP session, the BMP session remain
   alive, BMP buffer is being exported and normal operation continues.

   When TCP session is re-established without TCP Fast Open extension or
   with TCP Fast Open extension but cookie is not identically to
   previous TCP session, the BMP session is considered terminated and
   starts with a new BMP initiation message.

   When TCP session is not re-established within configured BMP timeout,
   than BMP buffer is discarded and BMP session is considered
   terminated.

6.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for TCP Fast Open RFC7413
   [RFC7413].

7.  Acknowledgements

   I would like to thank Pierre Francois, Paolo Lucente and Yunan Gu for
   their review and valuable comments.
